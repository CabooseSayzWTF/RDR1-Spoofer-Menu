# RDR1-Spoofer-Menu
Name Spoofer, Xuid Spoofer, Local Title Spoofer, Local Spoof Net Player Names  
  
This was originally made by JamesTwt and back then it was a Name Spoofer/steal xuid only script. I had my own name spoofer I made with the help of foxxyyy.  
It however was lost due to SSD failure and the only backup I had was just way to out of date for me to re-do it. James however let me  
have his as a base to work off of and I majorly improved upon it, so thanks again james!  

As is, this only works on Xbox, it should work on any game version for xbox besides the mem pointer to have name and title always showing on the player.  
However I have not tested, so there's your warning just incase it doesn't. This right now doesn't work on ps3 since I never made it compatible with ps3.  
It should however be easy enough to port to ps3 if somebody wants to port it. I may one day make this ps3 compatible myself, but right now don't have the time.  

If you make edits to the source, showcase it. Upload it elsewhere modified/non modified leave the original credits in the script as well as add the credits to  
wherever you upload/show it.
