This script source is no longer in support, so as such do not ask anything relating to this source. It will be ignored.
It is being left up for archival purposes and nothing more. With that said this was the final updates I was working on then abandoned.
The ps3 source is very very experimental and changes prob need made. The NPID spoofer/editor is weird for playstation and may need updated.
I've noticed that it has a tendency to make it where you only "communicate and see host of a session", other players will look like
they aren't loaded in. I'm pretty sure you need to have the npid match the acc name it was pulled from but unsure.
The name spoofer can also cause this as I target 4 different names in memory, you might need to remove the code for name2-4 but unsure.
I stopped messing with this source last year, so feel free to make it work better.

The title spoofer now actually spoofs the title and will sync to net clients now.
I also added a few new special chars for the name changer and what not. Regardless this will prob be my last update for this source, so enjoy!

Give credits where due if you edit this menu or showcase it etc.
